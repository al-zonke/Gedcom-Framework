**Note**: A work in progress. Selectors & classes may change name / appear / disappear.

A number of classes to ease [GEDCOM 5.5](http://www.gedcom.net/0g/gedcom55/)-manipulation in Cocoa through layers of abstraction. The intent is to hide the GEDCOM specifics, but to allow access if required. A short summary of the functionality follows:

* GEDCOM is parsed and serialized in layers: text <=> GCNode <=> GCObject.
* Closest to the metal are GCNodes, a simple representation of the nested structure of GEDCOM text data.
* Above GCNodes are GCObjects, which allow for more abstracted data access. There are two basic types of GCObject:
    - GCEntity: Root level records - INDI, FAM, etc.
    - GCProperty: Objects can have a number of properties of which there are two kinds:
        * GCAttribute: Any node that describes an object - NAME, DATE, PLAC, etc.
        * GCRelationship: Any node that references other entities - FAMC, HUSB, ASSO, etc.
* These are then further subclassed as for instance GCIndividualEntity, GCSpouseInFamilyRelationship, etc, providing convenience accessors to their properties.
* Mapping between GCNodes and GCObjects is facilitated by GCTags which know what subtags are valid, what type a value is, whether it's an entity or a property, etc.
* Attribute values are handled via subclasses of GCValue, which can be one of several types (like NSValue). Sorting and formatters are provided. The types are:
    - GCGender
    - GCAge (parsed via a Ragel state machine)
    - GCDate (parsed via a Ragel state machine)
    - GCString
    - GCNamestring
    - GCPlacestring
    - GCNumber
    - GCBool
* Relationship integrity is handled with a GCContext (equivalent to a file) that ensures that all GCEntities have an internal 1-to-1 mapping with an xref, used for serializing from/to GEDCOM.
* Objects and contexts can be validated and will return detailed NSErrors.

Full AppleDoc documentation in the headers, can be built with the Documentation target.

A simple GUI is included that can open a .ged file; it will display a list of the individuals with names and birth data, and allow the user to inspect the structures as gedcom strings as well as a hierarchy of display-formatted strings, as well as experiment with editing the Gedcom data directly, and see how it is parsed. Saving is not currently enabled to prevent accidental data loss. [Screenshot as of May 31, 2012](https://github.com/mikkelee/Gedcom-Framework/raw/master/screenshot.png)

# TODO #

The most important remaining issues, loosely prioritized in order of importance:

* **tags.json**: 99% done (is able to losslessly handle a real-world example generated by GEDitCOM II, simple.ged, as well as a slightly modified version of allged.ged).
* **Misc**: Handle special cases from spec; see SOURCE_CITATION in spec (use callbacks?).
* **Unit tests**: Full code coverage

Additionally there are various minor TODOs scattered around the source files.

# Examples #

Showing some different ways to add attributes to an object:

``` objective-c
    // Create a context
	GCContext *ctx = [GCContext context];
	
    // Create an individual entity in the context
    GCIndividualEntity *indi = [GCIndividualEntity individualInContext:ctx];
    
    // Create an array of names and set them on the individual for the property key "personalNames".
    // When an object receives GCValues for a property key, it will implicitly create attributes.
    // Likewise with GCEntities, creating relationships.
    NSArray *names = @[
        [GCNamestring valueWithGedcomString:@"Jens /Hansen/"], 
        [GCNamestring valueWithGedcomString:@"Jens /Hansen/ Smed"], 
    ];
    
    [indi setValue:names 
            forKey:@"personalNames"];
	
    // Create a birth attribute, give it a date attribute and add it to the individual
	GCBirthAttribute *birt = [GCBirthAttribute birth];
    
	[birt addAttributeWithType:@"date" value:[GCDate valueWithGedcomString:@"1 JAN 1901"]];
    
    [indi.allProperties addObject:birt];
    
    // You can also use subscripted access, in this case adding a single death attribute
    // with the value yes, indicating that the individual died.
    indi[@"deaths"] = @[[GCBool yes]];
```

The above is equivalent to the following GCNode:

``` objective-c
    GCNode *node = [[GCNode alloc] initWithTag:@"INDI" 
                                         value:nil
                                          xref:@"@INDI1@"
                                      subNodes:@[
                                                [GCNode nodeWithTag:@"NAME"
                                                              value:@"Jens /Hansen/"],
                                                [GCNode nodeWithTag:@"NAME"
                                                              value:@"Jens /Hansen/ Smed"],
                                                [GCNode nodeWithTag:@"BIRT"
                                                              value:nil
                                                           subNodes:@[ [GCNode nodeWithTag:@"DATE"
                                                                                     value:@"1 JAN 1901"] ]],
                                                [GCNode nodeWithTag:@"DEAT" 
                                                              value:@"Y"],
                                                ]];
```

And both are equivalent to the following Gedcom string:

```
0 @INDI1@ INDI
1 NAME Jens /Hansen/
1 NAME Jens /Hansen/ Smed
1 BIRT
2 DATE 1 JAN 1901
1 DEAT Y
```

Similarly, for relationships, the following:

```objective-c
	GCContext *ctx = [GCContext context];
	
	GCEntity *husb = [GCEntity entityWithType:@"individual" inContext:ctx];
	[husb addAttributeWithType:@"personalName" value:[GCNamestring valueWithGedcomString:@"Jens /Hansen/"]];
	[husb addAttributeWithType:@"sex" value:[GCGender maleGender]];
	
	GCEntity *wife = [GCEntity entityWithType:@"individual" inContext:ctx];
	[wife addAttributeWithType:@"personalName" value:[GCNamestring valueWithGedcomString:@"Anne /Larsdatter/"]];
	[wife addAttributeWithType:@"sex" value:[GCGender femaleGender]];
	
	GCEntity *chil = [GCEntity entityWithType:@"individual" inContext:ctx];
	[chil addAttributeWithType:@"personalName" value:[GCNamestring valueWithGedcomString:@"Hans /Jensen/"]];
	[chil addAttributeWithType:@"sex" value:[GCGender maleGender]];
	
    GCEntity *fam = [GCEntity entityWithType:@"family" inContext:ctx];
    
    [fam setValue:husb forKey:@"husband"];
    [fam setValue:wife forKey:@"wife"];
    [fam setValue:[NSArray arrayWithObject:chil] forKey:@"children"];
    
    //alternately:
	// [fam addRelationshipWithType:@"husband" target:husb];
	// [fam addRelationshipWithType:@"wife" target:wife];
	// [fam addRelationshipWithType:@"child" target:chil];
```

is equivalent to:

```
0 @FAM1@ FAM
1 HUSB @INDI1@
1 WIFE @INDI2@
1 CHIL @INDI3@
0 @INDI1@ INDI
1 NAME Jens /Hansen/
1 SEX M
1 FAMS @FAM1@
0 @INDI2@ INDI
1 NAME Anne /Larsdatter/
1 SEX F
1 FAMS @FAM1@
0 @INDI3@ INDI
1 NAME Hans /Jensen/
1 SEX M
1 FAMC @FAM1@
```

Test files used to verify GEDCOM compliance are from [Heiner Eichmann's GEDCOM 5.5 Sample Page](http://www.heiner-eichmann.de/gedcom/gedcom.htm) -- with one modification: allged.ged line 322 has a Hebrew date instead of the original Gregorian date.
